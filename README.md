#The program I chose for the codecademy project was the Telivision program. I used the same data structure (dictionaries) through out where one letter was attached to a category and each category had the list of channels attached to it.
For my algorithim, I initially used hashmap to pick a channel but I then realised it wasn't working because the hashmap array only a one key and one value pair so alist of channels as the value wouldn't work.
I then decided to use linear search algorithim to get the channel the user wants.
